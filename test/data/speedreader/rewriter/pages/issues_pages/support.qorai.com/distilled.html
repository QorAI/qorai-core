<p><strong>💡 Custodian ("custodial account" or "custodial wallet service"):</strong><span>A custodian is a company that holds your QOR for you. Crypto custodial wallet services and exchanges like Uphold, Gemini, and bitFlyer, for example, are custodial partners in the Qorai Rewards ecosystem.</span></p>
<p>Linking your Qorai Rewards wallet to a custodial wallet service allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Withdraw any QOR you have in your Qorai Rewards balance&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Add QOR into your Qorai Rewards balance</li>
<li>Send tips and contributions directly from your custodial account to creators</li>
</ul>
<p>When you verify Qorai Rewards, your Qorai Rewards balance becomes the QOR balance in your custodial account. (For example, if you have 255 QOR in your Gemini account, then if you verify Qorai Rewards with a Gemini account, then you will see that 255 QOR in your Qorai Rewards balance.) That means you can deposit additional QOR into your custodial account, and then use that QOR in the Qorai Rewards ecosystem (for example, to tip). It also means that when you send a tip to a creator, the QOR is being sent directly from your custodial account to the creator's custodial account.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>You cannot link 2 or more different accounts from the <strong>same</strong> custodian to a single browser instance. For example, you cannot have 2 accounts with Uphold and link them both to the same Qorai browser instance. If you try signing in with a second Uphold account, you will see an error.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to verify Qorai Rewards</h2>
<p>In Qorai, open your Rewards panel by pressing the triangular QOR icon in the URL bar, or go to <em>Settings &gt; Qorai Rewards</em> and click the "Unverified" button:</p>

<p><span>Then, select which custodial service you'd like to use.</span></p>
<p><img src="/hc/article_attachments/4545646045453/mceclip2.png" alt="mceclip2.png" width="509" height="323"></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to sign up with the custodian (or log in if you already have an account at that custodian).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>Make sure your account with the custodian is "verified" (i.e., that you have completed ID verification with the custodian).</span></p>
<p><span>You will be asked to authorize your Qorai Browser with your custodial account. Once you authorize the Qorai Browser, you should now "Verified" in the top left of the Rewards panel.</span></p>
<h2>Withdrawing funds</h2>
<p>When you first verify your Qorai Rewards with a custodial account, any existing QOR in your browser will be transferred over to your custodial account. For example, if you had 14 QOR in your browser prior to verifying, then after you've successfully verified and linked a custodial account to your browser, you should see that 14 QOR <em>automatically</em> appear inside your custodial account's QOR balance. (Please allow up to 30 minutes for your QOR to appear in your custodial account.)</p>
<h2>What can I do with the QOR once it's in my custodial account?</h2>
<p>Once the QOR is inside your custodial account, you can exchange it or withdraw it to an external Ethereum address as you would any other balance in your custodial or crypto exchange account.&nbsp;</p>
